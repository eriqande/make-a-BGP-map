## Packages Needed

### Non-standard Packages

This work draws on a few functions that I have in packages that I have up on GitHub,
namely:

1. **my fork** of `tess3r`.  Note that you can't use the default version of `tess3r`,
you have to use my fork of it, which has some extra functionality.
2. my package `genoscapeRtools`

Get those packages like this:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("eriqande/TESS3_encho_sen")  # for special version of tess3r
remotes::install_github("eriqande/genoscapeRtools")  # for Eric's genoscapeRtools
```

### Standard Packages

The rest of the packages you need can be downloaded from CRAN.  If you don't have
them you should get them: `raster`, `sf`, `tidyverse`. The last one there gets ggplot2
and a number of other packages by Hadley Wickham.

You can get those like this:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("raster", "sf", "tidyverse"))
```
