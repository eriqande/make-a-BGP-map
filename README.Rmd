Hello! This is the GitHub site for an Rstudio project that contains example
data and a notebook about how static maps are made for the [Bird Genoscape Project](https://www.birdgenoscape.org/).  We're talking here about the static 
maps with the genoscapes smeared across them, not the interactive maps that you
will find on the BGP website (those are made using a different set of packages in R).

Below is an example of the kind of map we are talking about.  Note that we are not
going to make that map exactly, because that was done in 2012 or so with very different
tools (I think I even made it using base R functions rather than ggplot). And some of the
elements in this figure are hand-placed.  

The landscape
has changed considerably, even in the last few years, so this is an update to 
BGP map-making using packages 'sf', 'ggplot2', 'ggspatial', and a handful of
others

To follow along with this process, clone this repository and follow
the steps and explanation in `Make-a-BGP-map-Notebook.Rmd`.  If you want to see 
what that notebook looks like in html, you can visit it at
